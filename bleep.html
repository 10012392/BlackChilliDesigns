<h1>Bleep</h1>

<img src="images/project_images/image7.PNG" width="100%" style="max-width:400px; border:1px solid white; box-shadow:grey 0 0 10px;">

<p>Sally and the team at Tuskany Agency worked with Terry at EOL and created a character, 
    a retro robot called Bleep, to be a part of EOL's internet package.</p>

<p>Terry and EOL have for several years been involved with the sponsors of a specific 
    scientific group called the Earth to Sky Calculus, based in the USA and headed by 
    Dr Phillips. They work with students to conduct experiments at 100,000+ feet, where
    the earth's atmosphere touches space, collecting the data with weather balloons.</p>

<p>The experiments habe been conducted in many US states and all over the world, 
    thanks to Terry and EOL for the first time in New Zealand.</p>

<p>Along with the science equitment and a GPS tracker the balloon can take
    a payload and also carry a camera which means the whole 2 - 3 hour trip to 
    space and back is recorded.</p>

<p>EOL wanted one of the payloads to be their mascot Bleep, but there was a problem,
    Bleep was a graphic design. So the task was to use their images to bring Bleep to 
    life as a 3D robot. He would then be mounted on a platform, fixed to the rails
    of the balloon and fly to space and back.</p>
